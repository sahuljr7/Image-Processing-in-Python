# Image-Processing-in-Python

Image processing has the lot of application in different fields like medical, traffic signals, computer science etc.

In this project, we have implemented some of the image processing operations which will help the user to understand the concept of image processing. Therefore, the scope of this project is increasing.  

The purpose of this project is to allow users to explore how digitized images can be processed using computer software.

# INTRODUCTION

Image Processing Python ProjectÂ is one form of signal processing for which the input is an image, such as photographs or frames of video; the output of image processing can be either an image or a set of characteristics or parameters related to the image. Image processing is a technique which involves different operation that can be performed on the image. Image processing plays a vital role in photography, computer science, and many other fields.

# What is Image?

Before understanding image processing, we have to first understand what is an image in technical terms. 

Image is a collection of pixels.

Pixel is a smallest unit in an image which contains color value.

Image is measured in PPI.

PPI stands for Pixels Per Inch. In one inch of image how many pixels are there.

# What is Image Processing?

Lets understand Image Processing in Layman Terms.

When we edit a photo, sometimes we blur the image, sometimes we sharpen the color, sometimes we reduce the noise or sometimes we increase the brightness of the image.

So these operations are called digital image processing.

Lets understand Image Processing in Technical Language.

When we perform the above operations with the help of algorithms on computers so the image gets manipulated, it is called digital image processing.
